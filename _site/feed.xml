If you haven’t visited yet details on how to find Freeside are &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.freeside.co.uk/t/finding-the-freeside-room/50/1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sign-up-now&quot;&gt;Sign up Now!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce offically that you can now sign up to a Freeside account &lt;a href=&quot;https://register.freeside.co.uk/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! With a Freeside account you can access any services we host and sign into the lab PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-new-room&quot;&gt;The New Room&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t57p8l2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the Freeside room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Room we currently have 3 PCs with i5 processors and SSDs but, we may be able to acquire more if we can show evidence of the room being used. The PCs have Fedora 27 installed on them, this was chosen for it’s ease of use for both users and admins. The machines are configured with a central login server as well as networked home directories. (You will not be able to access your University home directories from these computers but if you know how to do this please &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.freeside.co.uk/t/g-drive-mounting-script/30&quot;&gt;help us&lt;/a&gt;)
If you are wanting software installed on the machines you can follow the instructions to do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FreesideHull/Freeside-Fabfiles&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or make a request &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.freeside.co.uk/c/freeside/requests&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-else-is-new&quot;&gt;What Else Is New?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious change if you have previously visited this blog is the different look - that’s because we switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll!&lt;/a&gt; Ghost was great, but because of the lack of LDAP support (the system we use to centralise logins) we decided to drop it for a static &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FreesideHull/Freeside-Blog&quot;&gt;git managed&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.freeside.co.uk&quot;&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt; for discussion relating to Freeside, General chit chat and most importantly pictures of your cute cats. Be sure to head over to the Forum and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.freeside.co.uk/c/introductions&quot;&gt;introduce yourself&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thank you Nichtvren for the cute cats!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also now have the following services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.freeside.co.uk&quot;&gt;Gitlab&lt;/a&gt; - Host your private repositories here or use as an alternative to Github. We will be sticking with Github for our main repos for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.freeside.co.uk&quot;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt; - We are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://drone.io&quot;&gt;Drone&lt;/a&gt; to provide Continuous integration/Delivery linked to our Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also now have comments on the blog using Discourse so once you have finished reading this blog post be sure to post a comment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epictek(Kieran) is currently working on implementing OAuth with Github and Discord, This will allow getting new users on the Freeside github a lot simpler, The Discord OAuth will likely just be used to be verify that you are one of the awesome people to have signed up to a Freeside account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeside was started back in 1997 with a decommissioned Sun box and a frustration of the Universities strict single OS network. Over the years Freeside has been very volatile with many people trying to keep it going through out the years. The latest revive was started by a group of 2015 year students and whilst this latest attempt has been certainly rocky and we have not achieved much of what we set out to do, it has been fun to have a place with like minded people. Personally I have learnt a lot from Freeside that would have not had the opportunity otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;putting-the-servers-to-sleep&quot;&gt;Putting the servers to sleep.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of 2016 we were told by the department that we could not run the AC unit in the building and we was advised not to run any of our own servers either, this of course was a big problem for us as Freeside has always been about hosting our own physical servers. Andrew Hancock came up with the proposition of hosting our servers in the “cloud” after a meeting we decided that this is a compromise we would have to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/908/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_cloud.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://xkcd.com/908/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-eviction&quot;&gt;The Eviction.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the University has been through a restructure and had decided that 203 would be better off as something else. Thanks to some help from the awesome people in the CS department we managed to get some a new space for Freeside; the old CS Library! (Room 300) which will soon become the only Linux Lab on Campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-new-start&quot;&gt;The new start.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not allowed to host our own production hardware but the room has the advantage of being much more secure with card access required to enter the room, 7 modern PCs and the room also has a much more modern feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22007531_913197692165281_4143075104486123043_n.jpg?oh=a95b8c96e3c125d22211475ed747820b&amp;amp;oe=5AA122FB&quot; alt=&quot;The new room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-will-freeside-become-now&quot;&gt;What will Freeside become now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeside will mostly become a linux and UNIX Lab, we will continue to host our own services in the cloud but will be focusing more on development of Linux software and most importantly of all, having fun! We have already got a few fun projects planned such as building our own 3D printer and possibly a drone. We will also be focusing on hosting regular socials and hope to work alongside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/hullCSS/&quot;&gt;Hull University Computer Science Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;where-are-we-now&quot;&gt;Where are we now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well currently… nowhere. We hope to get access to the new room soon so we can start providing students with some UNIXy goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still keep up to date with our antics on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/freesideHull&quot;&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt;.
Our primary communications have been moved over to Discord which you can join here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to keep making more frequent blog posts and I’ll be spending the next few weeks updating the website and giving access to the forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;Thanks.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the students that have kept Freeside going throughout the years, you know who you are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a big shout-out to Andrew Hancock who has been constantly been putting up with Freeside and ensuring that we stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;

We were most excited as a HGV pulled into the courtyard outside Robert Blackburn, containing our package. It looked a little lonely being one of the two (rather small) remaining items in the behemoth of a delivery vehicle!
&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/fkNlxZM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Servers on the pallet&quot; /&gt;
The delivery driver was kind enough to wheel the pallet all the way up to the Freeside Office, where we  began to tear into it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package contained our order of 15 Dell Poweredge 1950s we had ordered from eBay, raising funds from the Freeside members. These machines combined come in at 60 cores and 240Gb RAM. A welcome addition to our Cluster! We look forward to unpacking them, installing hard drives, and getting them online!
&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/1ffx95s.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;All unpacked and ready to go&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more server-related fun!&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of progress has been made in getting our service online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the whole Freeside Cluster was rebuilt over the weekend, due to an issue with our SAN causing huge IO Wait on one of our nodes. It was determined the best way to repair this was to reimage, but this caused further issues with the quorum on the servers. In the end, we decided the best plan of action was to wipe everything and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, we were visited by a number of potential students during the University’s Applicant Day. It was great to meet an array of potential students, and answer some of their questions on the Linux platform and what we do. We may have some potential members for next year!
&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/m3XeP3L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Freeside Cluster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, we were pleased to receive donations of a Coffee Machine and a Fridge for Freeside. As you may or may not know, the IT Industry functions on Coffee and Soft Drinks. Our Tassimo Coffee Machine makes a great addition to the window ledge of our Office, and the Fridge is already full of Soft Drinks for the team. The Computer Science department were kind enough to donate some branded mugs to us for us to use with our new coffee machine, so many thanks to them.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Eu3J2DT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee Machine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this week, we’ve been working hard to refine our Standard Image that will be used on all of the hardware in our cluster, and on our Critical Services. We’re building in security and centralized User Management services to allow us to provide a consistent and easy to manage platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we managed to fundraise a significant amount among the team this week, and order 15 new Dell Poweredge Servers from eBay. These servers are a step up from our current equipment, and came at a very low cost to us. We hope to get these added to our cluster over Easter, before launching our services some time in the next Semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s been a busy week of meeting new people and solving new challenges. We hope you have a great week, and I’m sure we will plenty busy over the next seven days!&lt;/p&gt;
